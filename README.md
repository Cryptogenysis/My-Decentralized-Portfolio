Just updated & re-deployed my portfolio using a couple of cutting-edge #web3 tools. Now it is decentralized forever and nobody can take it down😁🤓👨🏾‍💻

(*cough cough* ICANN!😏)



Web3 tech used:

1) ENS Domain (nothingbutzero.x) 👻 



2) Metamask Wallet   (0xF11dE9f660c2Bba83771d7DAb1A8e3d8816cF1D2)👻 



3) IPFS Gateway (Fleek)👻 

-

Front End Version 1: https://ipfs.fleek.co/ipfs/QmSQybS6JTqQ5e8oQj6gtyyqppDSX6z2nhDgBNXdgZt8dW/
HTML5, CSS3, Javascript
Tweenmax (interactive animations)
Bootstrap5 (Responsiveness)

Front End Version 2: (Linked Below)
HTML & CSS
CSS Grid
Bootstrap
Three.JS (WebGL 3D animation)


 The downside about using ENS technology, is that most browsers do not yet natively support these new web3 domain extensions. 
This reminds me of when emojis were first adopted by the market in the early 2000's & not all ASCI compliant devices couldn't render them because .

The only solution to work with current browsers, that I have currently found is to point the browser directly to the IPFS gateway's hash URL (which looks disgusting🤢), instead of my actual Ethereum domain: nothingbutzero.x (dope AF😎). Changing URL's is a native security feature on all browsers implimented to protect the user from a hacker trying to mask a fake website.
