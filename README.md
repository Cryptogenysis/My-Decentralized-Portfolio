Just updated & re-deployed my portfolio using a couple of cutting-edge #web3 tools. Now it is decentralized forever and nobody can take it down😁🤓👨🏾‍💻👻 

(*cough cough* GoDaddy!😏)



Web3 tech used:

1) ENS Domain (nothingbutzero.x) 



2) Metamask Wallet   (0x8D6d703c97Ce3BB480c4DE6aAc179073171670Ea)



3) IPFS Host (Fleek Gateway)

-

Front End: 

HTML5, CSS3, Javascript

Tweenmax (interactive animations)

Bootstrap4 (Responsiveness)



 The downside about using ENS technology, is that most browsers do not yet natively support these new web3 domain extensions. 



This reminds me of when emojis were first introduced to the market

in the early 2000's & not all devices could render them.



The only solution to work with web2 browsers that I have currently found is to point the browser directly to the IPFS gateway's hash URL (which looks disgusting🤢), instead of my actual Ethereum domain: nothingbutzero.x (dope AF😎)
